# Portfolio Repository

This repository contains my portfolio built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and AccernityUI, deployed on Vercel.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter and Space Grotesk, custom Google Fonts.
